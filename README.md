# SSIS Data Warehouse Lab Project

This repository contains my implementation of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) exercises from the book  
**"The Data Warehouse Lab: A Step-by-Step Guide using SSIS and SSAS 2017" by Amin Jalali.**

## 📘 Overview
The project demonstrates how to design and build an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** data warehouse pipeline using SSIS.  
Each package in the solution represents a step from the lab, covering concepts like:
- Data extraction from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, SQL)
- Data transformation and cleaning
- Data loading into a target data warehouse
- Error handling and logging
- Control flow and data flow tasks

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS 2017)**
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **Visual Studio (SSDT)**
- **SQL Server Database Engine**
